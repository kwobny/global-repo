# Todo list for Kubuntu Linux OS
## That I have installed on my SD card
<br>

Things to do:
- Copy tasks over here
- Edit (/format) them
- Categorize them

<br>



- [ ] Find good Firefox themes
- [ ] Task switcher background & mac like toolbar
- [ ] Fix content zoom
    - There is global zoom in video settings
    - There is also application specific zoom. Apps configured with this zoom are:
        - Firefox
        - Discord
- [ ] Make toolbar icons larger?
- [ ] Adjust application launcher
- [ ] Maybe play around with task switcher themes
- [ ] Get minecraft bedrock free music dlc from marketplace
- [ ] See if you can increase minecraft render distance beyond 20
- [ ] Handle time differences in both os's
- [ ] Maybe make windows look for other os's on other drives before booting itself up
- [ ] You can use efibootmgr command to see windows boot order from inside linux
- [ ] Why does my linux take longer to boot than windows?
    - Maybe because it's a monolithic kernel?
    - Maybe it's just kubuntu that has slow boot time, not all of linux
    - Or maybe it's the fact that I'm running it off of an sd card
- [ ] Maybe see if you can free / optimize disk space in kubuntu drive
    - Also maybe optimize disk performance
- [ ] In firefox, maybe make the hover text show up quicker when you hover over inactive tabs
- [ ] Consider not using kdewallet
- [ ]
