Things to do: 
- [x] Edit realpath entry in script tips
- [x] Look at git config files in other local repos to copy to global config file
- [x] Include global config in local repository config files
- [ ] Consider making a way to save helpful oneliners in a script file
- [ ] Consider putting the global-config.txt file in the global repo and including it everywhere. If you do so, then you will have to either decide to
    
    - Put the file in the personal notes branch, but have its history polluted by the messy history intrinsic to personal notes branch.
    - Put the file in the general branch, but accept the fact that there is a file specific to just one person in a branch meant for all people to use.
    
  If you want to do better, you will have to figure something out.
    
- [ ] Consider creating a best practices file in global repo general branch to store notes on best git practices
- [ ] Maybe rebase branches in global repo and organize history
